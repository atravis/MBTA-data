MBTA-data

A project to create and load a database for working with transit data probided by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Autority (MBTA).
This includes GTFS files, csv files with real-time data, static csv files to supports the real-time data, and RSS feeds with service alerts.

The end result should be a database that will support a web site and mobile apps for transit riders.

Inital ideas for the GTFS database and loading data came from the Perl-GTFS project: https://github.com/perkinsms/Perl-GTFS
